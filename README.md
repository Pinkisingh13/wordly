# Wordly - A Category-Based Wordle Game


>  "**A developer is one who builds what they desire to see in reality.**"


While playing Wordle, I realized how challenging it is to guess a random word without any hints or categories. With billions of words in existence, it's almost impossible to know them all. That's when I identified a problem â€” Wordle should allow users to pick a category to make guessing more strategic and enjoyable. So, I built Wordly â€” a vibrant, playful Wordle game where users can guess words by choosing categories like Finance, Plants, Sports, and more. This enhances the guessing experience and gives players a fairer chance to win.

## App Description

Wordly is a colorful and engaging word-guessing game that lets users choose a word category before playing. This feature helps users narrow their guesses, improving the gaming experience.

**Categories Available:**

 - Finance
 - Plants
 - Sports
 - Food
 - Places
 - Social Media
 - Technology
 - Bollywood
 - Entertainment

**Screens in the App:**

 - Splash Screen

 - Home Screen (Choose category, start game)

 - Win Screen (If correct guess)

 - Game Over Screen (If all attempts fail)

**Additional Features:**

 - Users can view their score and streak.

 - After each game, users can explore the "Did You Know?" section to
   learn the word's meaning, synonyms, examples, and part of speech.

- The app boasts a playful and colorful UI with animations that enhance the user experience.

## Purpose & Goal

Wordly was created to solve the frustrating problem of random word guessing by introducing category-based gameplay, making the experience fairer and more engaging for players.

## Troubleshooting & Thought Process

Building Wordly was challenging but rewarding. Breaking down the logic step by step was the key to success. 
**I started by creating:**

- A category dropdown menu.

- A simple virtual keyboard.

- Snackbar alerts for winning/losing the game.

By starting small and gradually adding features, I achieved a well-structured and engaging app. Each step brought clarity to my logic and improved my understanding of Flutter development.
