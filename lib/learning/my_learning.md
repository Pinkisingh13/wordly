## In Flutter, the Container widget's size behavior depends on its parent widget and the constraints provided by the parent. When you wrap a Container inside a Column, the Column does not impose any constraints on the Container, so the Container will try to size itself based on its content and any constraints you provide directly

However, when you wrap a Column inside a Container, the Container can impose constraints on the Column, such as height and width, which the Column will then respect.

Here is a more detailed explanation:

Container inside Column:

The Column widget does not impose any constraints on its children, so the Container will size itself based on its content and any constraints you provide directly (e.g., height and width properties).
If you do not provide any constraints, the Container will try to be as small as possible while still fitting its content
